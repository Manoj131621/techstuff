      The technique has remained basically the same to the present day. The “metal” (molten glass having the consistency of molasses) is gathered on the end of a hollow pipe, inflated to a bubble, and formed into a vessel by blowing, swinging, or rolling on a smooth stone or iron surface (marver). Additions, such as stems, feet, or handles, are attached by welding. While still soft, the glass can be manipulated by hand tools or cut with shears. In the 17th century the gaffer’s “chair,” a bench with two extended arms on which the pipe is trundled to preserve the symmetry of the molten glass, came into use. The chair has been extended to include the glassmaking crew, the gaffer and two or three assistants.
